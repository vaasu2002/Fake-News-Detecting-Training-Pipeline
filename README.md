# Fake-News-Detecting-Training-Pipeline

This project aims to create a pipeline for retraining Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on new data to ensure that they continue to perform well over time. Deployed machine learning models are often static and can become outdated if they are not updated with new data. This pipeline aims to address this issue by providing an efficient and automated way to update the models with the latest data.
